                This site is a reconstruction of the orginal podium check site, which was created by Nate Mansfield, Nick Nolt, and two others as a semester project for CS341. As the original site was never fully functional, our aim with this site was to complete the missing features using more modern tools.
            </p>
            <p>
                Following the goal of the original site, Lighthouse Podium Check serves to improve upon the ITS department's process for completing podium checks, which ensure that classroom audio-video technology is functioning properly across campus.

                It is named "Lighthouse" because it guides the way to keeping the campus AV equipment functioning properly for users
